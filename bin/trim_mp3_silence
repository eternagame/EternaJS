# The original Eterna sounds frequently had tons of extra
# silence at their ends ("1-TextBubble-Click-A" was a < 0.5s
# sound with 19s of silence after it). This script uses the
# sox to trim the silence from the sounds. It'd be nice
# to do this on the uncompressed audio sources, if they're
# available somewhere.
