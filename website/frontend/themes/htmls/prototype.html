                            Eterna Script is an extensive JavaScript library that provides functionality for RNA folding. It provides the user with flexible tools to design their own RNA folding algorithms by giving them pre-defined functions that serve as building blocks for the actual algorithm.
                            <div style="height:10px;"></div>
                            One of the several good things about Eterna Script is that it can be used by both Eterna developers, to write scripts to improve the Eterna experience itself, and Eterna players, to design RNA Folding algorithms to solve puzzles. This flexibility is at the heart of Eterna Script, so as to allow it to augment the process of translating an idea into code and not prove to be a hindrance in the developmental process.
                            <div style="height:10px;"></div>
                            Eterna Script also serves as a core tool for players interested in participating in <a href="http://aayush.eternadev.org/web/prototypes/about/">RNA Algorithm Wars</a>, by providing them with a platform to design their RNA Folding algorithms on.

                         When Eterna Developers set out to identify a comprehensive RNA Folding library, that was not simply functionally sound, but was also easy to use, they pulled a blank. There are several RNA Folding libraries available but where some lack in functionality, others miss out on intuitiveness and ease of use. To fill this void and in the process provide Eterna players and algorithm designers with a comprehensive library that is intuitive to use, Eterna developers built the Eterna Script library on top of one of the most programming popular languages in the world, JavaScript.
                         <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                         What this entails is that the Eterna Script user is not simply limited to the Eterna Script library functionality but can also choose to develop in pure JavaScript, according to his/her needs. Eterna Script is designed with the aim of becoming a useful tool to design RNA Folding algorithms that can be used to tackle Eterna puzzles.

                            The RNA Algorithm Wars (RNA-AW) is a great opportunity for Eterna players to compete with each other and collectively promote a healthy competitive environment for fully understanding the concepts that go into RNA folding. Since RNA-AW focuses on designing the algorithms that govern RNA folding, it encourages participants to work out algorithmic techniques to solve RNA folding puzzles and discourages result oriented techniques tailored to specific puzzles, like brute forcing and hit-and-trial, to a large extent.
                            <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                            The Eterna RNA-AW is powered by Eterna's homebrew language <a href="http://aayush.eternadev.org/web/prototypes/eternascript/">Eterna Script</a>, the most comprehensive and advanced RNA folding library, written in Javascript, designed especially for Eterna. It gives the user enough flexibility to realize his ideas but at the same time, also takes care that the user does not feel lost or intimidated.

                        Eterna RNA-AW rankings are based on player ratings. The higher a player's rating, the higher his rank.

                          The ranking system of Eterna RNA-AW, although slightly complicated, is designed for accuracy and efficiency. Submitted algorithms and puzzles are rated relatively on their success rate against each other. The base rating (or average rating) for an algorithm and a puzzle when it starts off is 1200. This rating is improved everytime the algorithm solves a puzzle (and improves a lot if it solves a puzzle of a higher rating than its own!) and drops if it fails to solve a puzzle (and drops a lot if it fails to solve a lower rated puzzle). Puzzle ratings are also updated in a similar fashion. 
                          <div style="height:10px;"></div>
                          A general rule of thumb is that a difference of more than 200 points in rating corresponds to the higher rated algorithm or puzzle winning against the lower rated one with an estimated success percentage of 75%.

                          <div style="height:10px;"></div>
                          Before an algorithm competes with a puzzle, it's expected score is calculated according to the following rule:
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                        <div>
                          <img alt="The Update Formula" style="height:50px; width:157px; margin-left:250px" title="The Update Formula" src="http://aayush.eternadev.org/workbranch_aayush/frontend/themes/htmls/ExpectedFormula.png"  /></img>
                        </div>
                        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                        In the above formula, E(a) = Expected Score of the algorithm (Lies between 0 and 1), R(b) = Current Rating of the puzzle, R(a) = Current Rating of the algorithm
                        <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
                        The same method is used to calculate the expected score for the puzzle.
                        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                        Once the match is finished, the winner, either the algorithm or the puzzle, is assigned a score of 1 and the loser is assigned a score of 0. In case of a draw, a score of 0.5 is assigned to both the algorithm and puzzle. Following this, the new rating for both the algorithm and the puzzle is computed using the following update rule:
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                        <div>
                          <img alt="The Update Formula" style="width:188px;height:20px;margin-left:245px" title="The Update Formula" src="http://aayush.eternadev.org/workbranch_aayush/frontend/themes/htmls/update.png"  /></img>
                        </div>
                        <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
                        In the above formula, R'(a) = New Rating of the algorithm, R(a) = Current Rating of the algorithm, E(a) = Expected Score of the algorithm (Lies between 0 and 1), S(a) = Actual score obtained by the algorithm (Either 1, 0 or 0.5), K = Constant factor for dampening
                        <div style="height: 5px;"></div>
                        The same method is used to calculate the new rating for the puzzle.
                        <div style="height: 10px;"></div>
                        As far the player ratings go, they have two components: Peak Rating and Current Rating. The Peak Rating of a player corresponds to the rating of the best algorithm or the best puzzle submitted by the player. The Current Rating of the player is computed using the following formula:
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                        <div>

                          <img alt="The Decay Formula" style="width:259px;height:60px; margin-top:20px;margin-left:200px;" title="The Update Formula" src="http://aayush.eternadev.org/workbranch_aayush/frontend/themes/htmls/decay1.png"  /></img>
                        </div>
                        <div style="height:20px;"></div>
                        In the above formula, N = Number of Months since the best algorithm or puzzle was created by the player.
                        <div style="height:10px;"></div>
                        This prevents one single algorithm or puzzle dominating the rankings apart from providing incentive Eterna players to continue making new puzzles and algorithms.
